## Challenge Statement


## Additional Information
- How does a hydrate form and why does it cause production loss?
    - Oil wells produce more oil when gas is injected into them. High-pressure gas is delivered to a well from a compressor station via a pipeline. This pipeline is underground for the most part but rises above ground before it reaches a well to allow for maintenance when needed. However, sometimes the change in temperature and pressure that occurs at the riser can cause a hydrate to form. The formation of hydrates is not a desirable phenomenon as it blocks gas from being injected into the well, which in turn decreases oil production and could potentially cause the well to be shut in, costing the company millions of dollars.
